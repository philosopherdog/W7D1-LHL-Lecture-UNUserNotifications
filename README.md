## [fit]NotificationCenter vs. User Notifications
* So we've heard about `NotificationCenter`. 
* It uses the `Observer Design Pattern` to broadcast data from the system (or your own code) to your code in a completely decoupled way. 
* The class used for this is called `NotificationCenter`. 
* In contrast to `NotificationCenter`, there is a mechanism on iOS of user notifications.  Don't confuse the 2.
* User notifications enable an app that is no longer running to alert the user about some event. 
* User's can tap to launch the app from the notification or ignore them.

## [fit]Local vs Remote User Notifications
* Let's say the user wants to setup a calendar event inside your app. 
* User notifications can alert the user of this event when your app is not running.
* User notifications can be used to pass the user a message. 
* Like out calendar event, or it could be a timer event, location geofencing event, or some important data change on a remote server.
* There are 2 types of user notifications on iOS: `local` and `remote`.
* Local notifications are scheduled and sent by the app itself (no internet needed).
* Local and remote notifications look and sound the same from the user's point of view.

## [fit]Remote Notifications
* Remote notifications (aka `Push Notifications`) involve a remote server.
* Data may be sent from a dashboard to a remote service, some automated messaging setup, or it may originate from a user's device.
* Wherever it originates the message must be sent from a remote server to  `Apple's Push Notification Service` (APNS).
* APNS in turn calls the device(s) and sends the payload *securely*.
* Most BAAS systems also include push notification support. This is true of CloudKit, Firebase, and Parse.
* But it is pretty easy to roll your own push notification service.

## [fit]UILocalNotifications vs UNUserNotifications
* Note there are 2 Notification API's. `UILocalNotifictions`, and the new system called `UNUserNotifications`. 
* `UNUserNotifications` was introduced in iOS 10, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10. 
* You might need to use both API's in an app that is backward compatible. :(
* `UNUserNotifications` is way more powerful. (prefer current API's over legacy ones).

## [fit]Displaying Media & Attachments
* User Notifications can display alerts, and play default or custom sounds to the user, as well as badge the app icon with a number. 
* `UNUserNotifications` supports media attachments with the `UNNotificationAttachment` object. This allows attaching audio, video and images to your notifications.
* These attachments can't be sent remotely. Instead you will use a notification service extension to modify your remote notification before it is delivered which allows you to pull in resources locally or remotely. (see [UNNotificationServiceExtension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension) for more details.) 

## [fit]Configuring UNUserNotifications

1. Request authorization using `requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)` (same for both local and remote notifications)
1. Create and configure a `UNMutableNotificationContent` object with the notification details.
1. Create a `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`, `UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger`, or `UNLocationNotificationTrigger` object to describe the conditions under which the notification is delivered.
1. Create a `UNNotificationRequest` object with the content and trigger information.
1. Call the `addNotificationRequest:withCompletionHandler:` method to schedule the notification.

## [fit]Remote Notifications Requirements

1. RN require a device, and an Apple Developer Membership.
1. We will fake out the server using an app called [Pusher](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher).
1. Simple install: `brew cask install pusher` 

## [fit]Setup Push Service

1. Make sure you App's `Bundle Identifier` is unique.
1. Enable Push Service in the `Capabilities Tab` of your Xcode project.

## Enable Push Service Xcode

## Push Service Certificate
1. Log in to [https://developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/) and verify that your app has push notifications enabled (it will be amber).
1. Edit the permissions and click the *Create Certificate...* button for the *Development* type. Follow the instructions.
1. Add this downloaded certificate to the Mac keychain login.
1. Restart Pusher. Find the entry in Pusher and add the token. Test!

After you upload the certificate the amber light should turn to green.

## Codes

```swift

import UIKit
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  
  var window: UIWindow?
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    registerForNotifications(remote: true)
    return true
  }
}

```

```swift

extension AppDelegate {
  // Register to receive notifications
  
  private func registerForNotifications(remote: Bool = false) {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) {
      (granted, error) in
      print(#line, "Permission granted: \(granted)")
      guard granted else { return }
      self.checkNotificationSettings(remote: remote)
    }
  }
  
```

```swift

  private func checkNotificationSettings(remote: Bool) {
    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().getNotificationSettings { (settings) in
      print(#line, "Settings: \(settings)")
      guard settings.authorizationStatus == .authorized else {
        // Good place to notify the user how not having notifications might affect their experience
        return
      }
      // Register for Remove Notifications
      if remote {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
          UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
        }
      }
    }
  }

```
  
## More...

```swift

  // Remove notification Callbacks
  
  func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                   didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    let tokenParts = deviceToken.map { data -> String in
      return String(format: "%02.2hhx", data)
    }
    let token = tokenParts.joined()
    print("Device Token: \(token)")
    print(#line, token)
    // you could send this token to a server, but don't rely on it because it will change if the user deletes the app for example
  }
  
  func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                   didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
    print("Failed with error: \(error)")
  }
}
